Data Modeling
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.


Data Engineering

Used the information at hand to create a table schema for each of the CSV files. Set data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Import the schema into pgAdmin to create the database and tables
Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
